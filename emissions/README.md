# Emissions and Population Data Check

This project involved sourcing, cleaning, and inspecting emissions and population data using Python. The main objective was to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and reporting errors across datasetsâ€”such as mismatched year formats, suspicious spikes, and incomplete records.

All findings were documented through code comments and plots; no dashboard was created, as the focus was on data integrity rather than interface development.

## Data Source

Data was sourced from CDP:  
[2023 City-wide Emissions Dataset](https://data.cdp.net/Emissions/2023-City-wide-Emissions/u5an-e63y/about_data)
